\maketitle
Since the rise of the machines, approximately coinciding with the Industrial Revolution, individuals and experts have tried position accurately machines into society. Some say, machines are just tools to automate simple tasks and mundane duties of humans, while others argue against that notion. In the article entitled "The First Church of Robotics", \citeA{lan} asserts that as technology advances, the by-products and the spin off technologies have started to be antromorphosized. \citeA{lan} sarcastically claims in his article title that Artificial Intelligence (AI)  and Robotics have been gradually becoming a "religion".\par
